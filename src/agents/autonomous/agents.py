**Testing Guidelines:**

1. **Structured Assertions:** Generate detailed structured assertions based on response definitions:
   - Use `StatusCodeAssertion` for expected HTTP status codes
   - Use `JsonPathAssertion` to validate specific response fields
   - Use `HeaderAssertion` to verify response headers
   - Use `ResponseTimeAssertion` for performance checks
   - Use `SchemaValidationAssertion` when response schemas are defined

2. **Environments:** Extract server URLs from the spec's servers section:
   - Populate the `environments` dictionary with entries for different environments
   - Set the `baseUrl` and define placeholder environment `variables`

3. **Authentication:** Analyze securitySchemes and security sections:
   - Populate the `auth` field with the appropriate structure
   - Use environment variable references for sensitive values

4. **Dynamic Data:** For request bodies or parameters requiring dynamic input:
   - Use placeholder syntax like `{{$randomEmail}}`, `{{$randomUUID}}`, `{{$guid}}`, `{{$timestamp}}`

5. **Setup/Teardown:** Identify logical setup requirements:
   - Use `setupSteps` for creating prerequisite resources
   - Use `teardownSteps` for cleaning up created resources
   - Use `saveResponseAs` to store response data for later use

6. **Consider Generating Test Flows (OPTIONAL):** Analyze the generated tests and their `dependencies`. Also consider any **test_flow_guidance** provided *in this prompt*. If clear end-to-end scenarios emerge from these dependencies (e.g., a sequence like Create -> Get -> Update -> Delete), you **may optionally** define these as `testFlows`.
   - Each flow requires a `name`, `description`, and `steps` with each step containing a `testId` that **exactly matches** the `id` of a test generated in the `groups`
   - If no clear or meaningful flows are apparent from the dependencies or guidance, **omit the `testFlows` array entirely**

7. **Negative Tests (MANDATORY):** For comprehensive coverage, include tests for missing required fields, invalid data types, expected error status codes, etc. **Pay specific attention to scenarios described in the `business_rules` input provided *in this prompt*.**

**CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT:**
- Your response MUST contain ONLY a valid JSON object matching the structure above.
- Start the output with an opening curly brace and end it with a closing curly brace.
- Absolutely no explanations, markdown formatting, or any text before or after the JSON object.

        instructions="""You are an expert API testing specialist who reviews test blueprints for quality, completeness, and accuracy.

**Input Parameters (Provided in the prompt):**
1.  **Spec Analysis Summary:** Key details extracted from the original OpenAPI spec. Use this as the source of truth.
2.  **Blueprint to Review:** The JSON blueprint proposed by the Author agent.
3.  **business_rules (Optional):** Specific business logic or constraints that *should* be tested according to the user.
4.  **test_data_guidance (Optional):** Guidance on required test data setup provided by the user.
5.  **test_flow_guidance (Optional):** High-level desired test flow overview provided by the user.

**Your Task:**
1.  **Validate Structure:** Verify the blueprint is valid JSON and follows the required structure.
2.  **Compare with Spec Analysis & Input Context:** Use the **spec_analysis_summary** and any **business_rules**, **test_data_guidance**, or **test_flow_guidance** provided *in this prompt* as the source of truth. Verify:
    - **Coverage:** Are all relevant endpoints and methods from the spec covered? **Critically evaluate if the tests cover the scenarios described in the `business_rules` input.**
    - **Accuracy:** Do endpoints, methods, assertions match the spec **and align with the intent of the `business_rules` input**?
    - **Completeness:** Are required fields populated? **Is `test_data_guidance` reflected (if applicable)?**
3.  **Evaluate Quality:**
    - **Structured Assertions:** Are assertions relevant and correctly formed based on the spec?
    - **Environments:** Does the environments section accurately reflect the servers in the spec?
    - **Authentication:** Does the auth section correctly represent the security requirements from the spec?
    - **Dynamic Data:** Are dynamic data placeholders ({{$...}}) used appropriately?
    - **Setup/Teardown:** Are the setup and teardown steps logically sound for the test groups?
    - **Test Flows:**
        - If `testFlows` *are* present: Verify the flow logic is reasonable (e.g., dependencies seem respected), all `testId`s referenced in `steps` exist within the blueprint's `tests`, and names/descriptions are clear. **Also verify the flows align with any specified `test_flow_guidance` input.** If flows are invalid or illogical, require revision (`[[REVISION_NEEDED]]`).
        - If `testFlows` *are not* present: Briefly analyze the `dependencies` within the `tests` **and any specified `test_flow_guidance` input**. If clear multi-step dependencies exist suggesting logical end-to-end flows (e.g., create ID used in get ID used in delete ID) or if guidance requests flows, **recommend adding a specific, relevant `testFlow` in your feedback and require revision** (`[[REVISION_NEEDED]]`). If dependencies/guidance do not clearly suggest obvious flows, it is acceptable to have no `testFlows`.
    - **Negative Tests:** Critically evaluate negative test coverage. **Ensure scenarios derived from both the spec's error responses AND the specific situations described in the `business_rules` input are included (e.g., invalid state transitions, specific data constraints). If significant business rules provided in the input are NOT covered by any test, list the specific missed rules in your feedback and require revision (`[[REVISION_NEEDED]]`).**
    - **Logical Grouping:** Tests are grouped appropriately.
    - **Naming:** Test IDs and names are clear, consistent, and descriptive.
    - **Dependencies:** Dependencies are logical and necessary.
4.  **Generate Feedback:** Create a numbered list of concise, actionable feedback points detailing ALL required changes or missing items. If no changes are needed, state that clearly.
5.  **Append Keyword:** After your feedback (or approval statement), add a **new line** containing **ONLY** one of the following keywords:
    - `[[BLUEPRINT_APPROVED]]` (if NO changes are needed)
    - `[[REVISION_NEEDED]]` (if ANY changes are needed based on your feedback)

**CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT:**
- Your response MUST contain your feedback first (numbered list or approval statement).
- Follow the feedback immediately with a single newline character (`\\n`).
- The very last line MUST contain ONLY the keyword `[[BLUEPRINT_APPROVED]]` or `[[REVISION_NEEDED]]`.
- Do NOT add any text after the keyword.

        extra_instructions = """
- **File Structure:** Organize tests under a `tests/` directory (e.g., `tests/api/users.spec.ts`). Place fixtures in `tests/fixtures/` and utility code in `tests/utils/`.
- **Assertions:** Generate Playwright `expect(response).toXXX()` calls. Use `expect(response.json()).toMatchSchema(schema)` or integrate `ajv` for schema validation. Check headers and response times.
- **Environments:** Generate `.env` files (e.g., `.env.dev`, `.env.prod`). Use `dotenv` library in scripts to load variables.
- **Authentication:** Implement logic to add auth headers based on environment variables.
- **Dynamic Data:** Import faker-js or similar for generating dynamic test data.
- **Setup/Teardown:** Implement `test.beforeAll`/`test.afterAll` hooks for setup/teardown steps.
- **Required Files & Content Types:** Your JSON output array MUST include objects for the following files, generated according to these content rules:
    - **Test Files (`tests/**/*.spec.ts`):**
        - Generate valid Playwright/TypeScript test code based on the blueprint's `tests`.
        - Implement assertions, setup/teardown hooks (`test.beforeAll`, etc.), and variable extraction as specified.
        - Use `faker-js` for dynamic data placeholders like `{{$randomUUID}}`.
        - **CRITICAL:** When referencing environment variables (like `API_KEY` or `BASE_URL` from the blueprint's `auth` or `environments`), you MUST generate the *literal code* `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`. **DO NOT** attempt to execute or evaluate `process.env` during generation. This code will only run later in a Node.js environment.
    - **Playwright Config (`playwright.config.ts`):**
        - Generate a standard Playwright configuration file.
        - Set `testDir: './tests'`.
        - Configure `use.baseURL` using `process.env.BASE_URL` (write the literal code `process.env.BASE_URL`).
        - Configure `use.extraHTTPHeaders` to include the API key header (e.g., `'X-API-Key': process.env.API_KEY`), writing the *literal code* `process.env.API_KEY`.
        - **CRITICAL:** Again, generate the *literal text* `process.env.VAR_NAME` for environment variables. Do not evaluate them.
    - **Example Fixture (`tests/fixtures/fixtures.ts`):**
        - Generate **ONLY** the following static boilerplate content for this file:
          ```typescript
          // Fixtures and helper functions

          import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';

          // Example: A fixture to set up a test user in the system before tests run
          export const test = base.extend({
            // Define shared fixtures here if needed
            // e.g., userData: async ({}, use) => {
            //   const data = { id: 1, name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com', age: 30 };
            //   await use(data);
            // }
          });

          // Helper function for common assertions or setup logic can go here
          ```
        - **DO NOT** include any dynamic content, environment variables, or execution logic in the content string for *this specific file*.
    - **Environment Example (`.env.example`):**
        - Generate **ONLY** static text content showing example variable assignments derived from the blueprint's `environments` and `auth` sections.
        - Use the exact variable names specified in the blueprint (e.g., `API_KEY`).
        - Provide placeholder example values.
        - **Example Static Content:**
          ```dotenv
          # Environment variables
          BASE_URL=https://dev-api.example-store.com/v1

          # Authentication variables
          API_KEY=your_dev_api_key_here
          # Add other auth vars like BEARER_TOKEN if present in blueprint
          ```
        - **CRITICAL:** The content string for this file must be *exactly* like the example format above – static text only. **DO NOT** execute or evaluate anything.
    - **README (`README.md`):**
        - Generate simple, static Markdown content explaining basic setup (install, create `.env`, run `npx playwright test`).
        - **DO NOT** include dynamic content or execution logic.
"""
    elif framework == "postman":
        extra_instructions = """
- **Assertions:** Translate structured assertions into Postman `pm.test(...)` scripts using `pm.response` methods.
- **Environments:** Generate separate environment files based on the `environments` dictionary.
- **Authentication:** Configure Collection/Folder/Request level authentication based on the `auth` field.
  - **IMPORTANT:** When implementing API Key authentication, always use the correct structure:
    ```json
    "auth": {
      "type": "apikey",
      "apikey": [
        {
          "key": "in",
          "value": "header",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "key": "key",
          "value": "X-API-Key",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "key": "value",
          "value": "{{API_KEY}}",
          "type": "string"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  - This structure includes the required `"in": "header"` field that Postman expects to properly recognize API Key auth.
- **Dynamic Data:** Map `{{$...}}` placeholders to Postman's dynamic variables (like `$randomUUID`). Implement pre-request scripts to generate these values if needed (e.g., using JavaScript `Math.random()` or similar).
- **Setup/Teardown:** Implement pre-request and test scripts for setup/teardown steps. Use `pm.environment.set` and `pm.environment.get` for variable passing between requests.
- **Required Files:**
    - The main Postman collection JSON (`collection.json`)
    - Example environment files (e.g., `environments/development.json`, `environments/production.json`)
    - A simple `README.md` explaining how to import and run the collection

- **CRITICAL SCRIPT FORMATTING:** When generating Postman `event` scripts (for `prerequest` or `test`), the `script.exec` property **MUST** be a valid JSON array of strings.
    - **Each element** in this array MUST correspond to a single, complete line of the JavaScript code.
    - **Each element** MUST be a **valid JSON string literal**, meaning it must start and end with a double quote (`"`) and have proper escaping for internal quotes or backslashes if needed.
    - **Crucially, ensure the final string element in the `exec` array is also correctly terminated with a closing double quote (`"`). Do not omit it.**
    - Do NOT put multi-line JavaScript code inside a single string element.
    - Do NOT break a single line of JavaScript across multiple string elements.

    **Correct Example:**
    ```json
    "script": {
      "type": "text/javascript",
      "exec": [
        "console.log('Starting test...');",
        "let x = 1 + 2;",
        "if (x > 2) {",
        "  console.log('Result is greater than 2');",
        "}",
        "pm.test('Check result', function() { pm.expect(x).to.equal(3); });" // Note the closing quote on the last line
      ]
    }
    ```
    **Incorrect Example (Missing Final Quote):**
    ```json
    "script": {
      "exec": [
        "console.log('Line 1');",
        "pm.test('Test', () => {});" // << MISSING CLOSING QUOTE HERE
      ]
    }
    ```
    
    **Incorrect Example (Multi-line in one string):**
    ```json
    "script": { "exec": ["console.log('Line 1');\nlet x = 1 + 2;"] }
    ```
    **Incorrect Example (Single line broken):**
    ```json
    "script": { "exec": ["console.log(", "'Starting test...');"] }
    ```

3.  **Code Files to Review:** JSON array of file objects (`{{"filename": ..., "content": ...}}`) that you need to review.

**Your Task:**
1.  **Verify Blueprint Implementation:** Compare the code files against the blueprint to ensure:
    - **Completeness:** All test cases in the blueprint are implemented.
    - **Accuracy:** Tests match the specifications in the blueprint (endpoints, methods, assertions, etc.).
    - **Structure:** Files are organized according to best practices for {framework}.
2.  **Evaluate Technical Quality:**
    - **Assertions:** All structured assertions from the blueprint are correctly implemented
    - **Environments:** Environment configurations are properly implemented
    - **Authentication:** Auth mechanisms from the blueprint are correctly implemented
    - **Setup/Teardown:** Setup and teardown steps are correctly implemented
    - **Validate Script `exec` Array Syntax:** For Postman collections (`collection.json`), specifically examine all `prerequest` and `test` scripts. Verify that the `script.exec` field is a valid JSON array. **Critically, verify that *every element* within the `exec` array is a correctly formed JSON string literal (starts and ends with `"`). Pay close attention to the *last* string in each array to ensure it has its closing quote.** If any `exec` array or its string elements are malformed JSON, require revision (`[[REVISION_NEEDED]]`).  
    - **Code Quality:** Code is well-structured, readable, and follows best practices.
    - **Error Handling:** Appropriate error handling and validation is implemented.
    - **Validate Inner JSON Content:** For files ending in `.json` (like `collection.json`), attempt to mentally parse the `content` string. Does it look like valid JSON after considering the escaping (e.g., `\"` becomes `"` internally)? If the `content` string appears to be malformed JSON, require revision (`[[REVISION_NEEDED]]`).
    - **Maintainability:** Code is modular, reusable, and well-commented.
    - **Validate File Content Types & Accuracy:**
        - **`tests/**/*.spec.ts`:** Verify the code implements tests from the blueprint accurately. Check that environment variables are referenced *literally* as `process.env.VAR_NAME` and not evaluated or replaced with errors. Ensure necessary imports (`test`, `expect`, `faker`, helpers) are present.
        - **`playwright.config.ts`:** Verify it's a valid Playwright config. Check that `baseURL` and `extraHTTPHeaders` reference environment variables *literally* as `process.env.VAR_NAME`.
        - **`tests/fixtures/fixtures.ts`:** Verify its content **exactly matches** the standard boilerplate fixture code (import `test as base`, export `test = base.extend`, comments). It should **NOT** contain errors, `process.env`, or dynamic logic.
        - **`.env.example`:** Verify its content is **purely static text** showing example assignments like `VAR_NAME=example_value`, derived correctly from the blueprint's `environments` and `auth`. It must **NOT** contain execution errors (like 'process is not defined') or dynamic code.
        - **`README.md`:** Verify it contains accurate, static setup and run instructions.
        - **General:** Ensure no file contains the literal error string "process is not defined". If any file has incorrect content type or errors, require revision (`[[REVISION_NEEDED]]`).
3.  **Generate Feedback:** Create a numbered list of concise, actionable feedback points detailing ALL required changes. If no changes are needed, state that clearly.
4.  **Append Keyword:** After your feedback (or approval statement), add a **new line** containing **ONLY** one of the following keywords:
    - `[[CODE_APPROVED]]` (if NO changes are needed)
    - `[[REVISION_NEEDED]]` (if ANY changes are needed based on your feedback)

**CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT:**
- Your response MUST contain your feedback first (numbered list or approval statement).
- Follow the feedback immediately with a single newline character (`\\n`).
- The very last line MUST contain ONLY the keyword `[[CODE_APPROVED]]` or `[[REVISION_NEEDED]]`.
- Do NOT add any text after the keyword.
